By providing everything from simple widgets to templatized solutions, the Marketplace has the resources you need to build innovative solutions. You can browse all the content in the Mendix Marketplace, get what you need to kick start your development, and share the content you have created, which includes your commercial offerings. 

A robust ecosystem is crucial to supporting the flow of value to Mendix Makers, and Mendix Partners are at the core of that ecosystem. We want you to be a part of the Mendix Marketplace so you can help other Makers see what is possible.
